        <h1>Hawa Mahal</h1>
        <p id="about">The <b>Hawa Mahal</b> is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace,
            Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.
           The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh,
        the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal
         that he built this grand and historical palace.
         It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas 
         decorated with intricate latticework.The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life 
         and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi
          effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.
         Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.<br>
         This palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room,
         while the first and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes.
         Each porthole has miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique fa√ßade.
         The inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor.
         The interior of the palace has been described as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding; while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard".<br>
         The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides,
         with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side. An archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard.
