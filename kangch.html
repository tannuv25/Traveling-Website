        <h1>Kangchenjunga View point</h1>
        <p id="about">
            The <b>Kanchenjunga mountain</b> has a towering presence in <b>Darjeeling</b>. It is the main reason why Darjeeling, Gangtok and the surrounding areas of North Bengal and Sikkim get so many tourists.
            Kanchenjunga is the highest and most beautiful mountain peak in India, and the third highest in the world at 8586 meters. There are many viewpoints in Darjeeling from where we can get a fantastic view of the mountain on a clear day.
            The most popular of these places are Tiger Hill and Batasia Loop, and the best time is at sunrise when one can see the colours on the peak changing from red to pink to yellow and finally to white. We were lucky to get fabulous views of the entire Kanchenjunga range from Sandakphu, 
            which is the highest peak in West Bengal, about 58 km from Darjeeling. The entire range is popularly referred to as the ‘Sleeping Buddha’ because of it’s appearance, with the head of the Buddha in the west and the feet in the east. Mt. Kumbhakarna forms the head and face,
            Mt. Pandim forms the feet and Mt. Kanchenjunga constitutes the belly of the Buddha.<br>
            Kangchenjunga, also spelled Kanchenjunga, Kanchanjanghā and Khangchendzonga, is the third-highest mountain in the world. Its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas, the Kangchenjunga Himal, which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River,
            in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River.It lies in the border region between Nepal and Mangan district, Sikkim state of India, with three of the five peaks,
            namely Main,Central and South, directly on the border,and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District.<br>
            Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, 
            it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.<br>
            The Kangchenjunga landscape is a complex of three distinct ecoregions: the eastern Himalayan broad-leaved and coniferous forests, the Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands.[13] The Kangchenjunga transboundary landscape is shared by Nepal, India, Bhutan and China, and comprises 14 protected areas with a total of 6,032 km2 (2,329 sq mi).
